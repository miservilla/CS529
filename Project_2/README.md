# Naive Bayes

- main.py
- test.p

## Description

The Naive Bayes implementation uses two scripts to run. These scripts need to be
run in order main.py and then test.py. Main first creates and saves a matrix containing the MAP 
values and the MLE values for the training data set proveded. Train then uses the matrix
created by main to find the predicted targets for the provided testing data. Both scripts 
can be run for a singlular Beta value or run in a loop to test multiple Beta values at
once.
